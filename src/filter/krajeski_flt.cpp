/*
This class implements Tim Stilson's MoogVCF filter
using 'compromise' poles at z = -0.3

Several improments are built in, such as corrections
for cutoff and resonance parameters, removal of the
necessity of the separation table, audio rate update
of cutoff and resonance and a smoothly saturating
tanh() function, clamping output and creating inherent
nonlinearities.
