# AcidBox S3
ESP32 headless acid combo of tb303 + tb303 + tr808 like synths. Filter cutoff, reso, env mod, accent, wavefolder, overdrive within each 303, per-instrument tunings, hi-pass/lo-pass filter and bitcrusher in drums, send to reverb, delay and master compression.
All MIDI driven. 44100, 16bit stereo I2S output to the external DAC or 8bit to the built-in DAC. No indication. Uses both cores of ESP32. Cheap ~$10.
Consult with midi_config.h to find out and to set up MIDI continous control messages.

# It can be a JukeBox
If you compile with #define JUKEBOX option in config.h, this becomes a stand-alone ACID-JUKE-BOX. You just listen.

# To build the thing
Ideally, you need an ESP32 or ESP32S3 with at least 4MB PSRAM (for example, ESP32 WROVER module). Also an external DAC, like PCM5102 is highly preferrable. 

<b>ATTENTION! PSRAM handling requires up-to-date Arduino ESP32 core. Of what I have tested, versions 2.0.6 up to current 2.0.14 are working with both ESP32 and ESP32S3, while 2.0.0 is not working</b>

In ArduinoIDE (I've used v.1.8.20) select: 
* board: ESP32 Dev Module (or ESP32S3 Dev Module if you use S3)
* partition scheme: No OTA (1MB APP/ 3MB SPIFFS)
* PSRAM: enabled (or the type of your PSRAM)

Also you will need to upload drum samples to the ESP32 flash (LittleFS). To do so follow the instructions:

for Arduino IDE 1.X.X https://github.com/lorol/LITTLEFS#arduino-esp32-littlefs-filesystem-upload-tool

for Arduino IDE 2.X.X https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-littlefs-upload and follow the instructions there.

Don't forget to select the appropriate partitioning both for uploading app and fs image in the tools menu: No OTA 1mb app+3mb SPIFFS. Choose LittleFS while uploading.

If you don't upload samples, the app will use the default drum kit from the samples.h

# Dependencies
* MIDI Library https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library

# What if you only have WROOM module (no PSRAM)
You can still compile and run the app, with NO_PSRAM option (line 11 in config.h). Note, that in this case you will get NO REVERB and just ONE SMALL DRUM KIT. 

In ArduinoIDE (I used v.1.8.20) select: 
* board: ESP32 Dev Module
* partition scheme: No OTA (1MB APP/ 3MB SPIFFS)
* PSRAM: disabled

Also you will need to upload drum samples to the ESP32 flash (LittleFS). To do so follow the instructions: https://github.com/lorol/LITTLEFS#arduino-esp32-littlefs-filesystem-upload-tool

# What if you don't have an external DAC module (PCM5102)
You can still compile and run the app, with USE_INTERNAL_DAC option (line 10 in config.h). BUT you should understand that sound output is 8-bit. You just get it form GPIO25 and GPIO26. Probably you can improve it a bit playing with the multipliers in i2s_output() method in general.ino file.
